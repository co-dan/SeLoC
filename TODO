-	Several typeclasses ending in *G that must be global singletons
	(such as irisDG, heapDG, heapG1/heapG2, ...) should be renamed
	to *GS. Their corresponding preG class should be renamed to GpreS.
	This is to conform with
	https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris/-/merge_requests/678

-	I don't know why examples/value_sensitivity_3.v line 303 doesn't
	work anymore. I removed it from the _CoqProject for now.
